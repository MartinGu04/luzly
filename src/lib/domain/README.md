# lib/domain

Business rules operating on parsed domain objects: conflict detection,
manager reconciliation, "who is with me", derived reminders. Pure logic,
no Google API calls and no spreadsheet-cell access.

- `types.ts` — `Person`, the typed personnel record produced by
  `lib/parsers/personnel.ts`. Existing in this list does not imply a
  person is scheduled/active on a given date — no such flag is stored
  here.
- `event.ts` — the `Event` model (and its category/role/period/certainty/
  duty-family unions) produced by `lib/parsers/event.ts` from a
  `RawAssignment`. This — not `RawSheet`/`RawAssignment` — is what a
  future rules engine and the UI should consume.
- `shiftSchedule.ts` — builds the day/night shift schedule from the
  workbook's configured day-shift start (never falls back to a default
  time — `ShiftConfigurationError` on missing/invalid config), and
  `resolveEventShiftInterval` for a single shift `Event`'s effective
  start/end minute interval, respecting `startTimeOverride`/
  `endTimeOverride`. Deterministic minute arithmetic only, no
  `Date`/UTC — a night shift crosses midnight without touching
  `Event.date`.
- `shiftCoverage.ts` — `analyzeShiftCounterparts`, the "מי איתי?"
  counterpart matcher and structural shift-coverage engine (opposite
  role, same date/period; shadow shifts never count as primary
  coverage; partial counterpart intervals merge into full coverage;
  missing coverage is returned as machine-readable gaps). Structural
  coverage only — certainty (confirmed/tentative) is preserved
  untouched; whether tentative coverage should count as operationally
  confirmed is left to a future rules engine, not decided here. No
  alert/severity logic.
