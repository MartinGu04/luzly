# lib/domain

Business rules operating on parsed domain objects: conflict detection,
manager reconciliation, "who is with me", derived reminders. Pure logic,
no Google API calls and no spreadsheet-cell access.

- `types.ts` — `Person`, the typed personnel record produced by
  `lib/parsers/personnel.ts`. Existing in this list does not imply a
  person is scheduled/active on a given date — no such flag is stored
  here.
- `event.ts` — the `Event` model (and its category/role/period/certainty/
  duty-family unions) produced by `lib/parsers/event.ts` from a
  `RawAssignment`. This — not `RawSheet`/`RawAssignment` — is what a
  future rules engine and the UI should consume.
